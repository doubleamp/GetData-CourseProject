Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project (Codebook)
=====================================================

This document is the codebook for the 'UCI-HAR_Dataset_Means_of_Extracted_Data.csv' file obtained as the 'second tidy data set' as described in the project presentation. It presents the names of the variables and their explanation.

Variable Name          Description
------------------     -----------
subject.id         ->  Number (from 1 to 30) identifying the subject from which the data comes
activity.name      ->  Name of the activity being done when the data was recorded
tbodyacc.mean.x    ->  Mean of the mean acceleration of the body readings (X-axis)
tbodyacc.mean.y    ->  Mean of the mean acceleration of the body readings (Y-axis)
tbodyacc.mean.z    ->  Mean of the mean acceleration of the body readings (Z-axis)
tbodyacc.std.x     ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the acceleration of the body (X-axis)
tbodyacc.std.y     ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the acceleration of the body (Y-axis)
tbodyacc.std.z     ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the acceleration of the body (Z-axis)
tgravityacc.mean.x ->  Mean of the mean gravity acceleration readings (X-axis)
tgravityacc.mean.y ->  Mean of the mean gravity acceleration readings (Y-axis)
tgravityacc.mean.z ->  Mean of the mean gravity acceleration readings (Z-axis)
tgravityacc.std.x  ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the gravity acceleration (X-axis)
tgravityacc.std.y  ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the gravity acceleration (Y-axis)
tgravityacc.std.z  ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the gravity acceleration (Z-axis)
tbodygyro.mean.x   ->  Mean of the mean gyroscope readings (X-axis)
tbodygyro.mean.y   ->  Mean of the mean gyroscope readings (Y-axis)
tbodygyro.mean.z   ->  Mean of the mean gyroscope readings (Z-axis)
tbodygyro.std.x    ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the gyroscope readings (X-axis)
tbodygyro.std.y    ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the gyroscope readings (Y-axis)
tbodygyro.std.z    ->  Mean of the standard deviation of the gyroscope readings (Z-axis)

The file 'UCI-HAR-Dataset_Mean_and_Std_Data.csv' contains basically the same type of data, but with the original readings from the sensors (in terms of mean and standard deviations), without further processing (i.e., mean calculation).

In all the cases, the presented data includes that coming from the train and test subsets.
